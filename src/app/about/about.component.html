      Fully committed to the philosophy of life-long learning, I’m a full stack
      developer with a deep passion for JavaScript, React and all things web
      development. The unique combination of creativity, logic, technology and
      never running out of new things to discover, drives my excitement and
      passion for web development. When I’m not at my computer I like to spend
      my time reading, keeping fit and playing guitar.
